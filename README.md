# Fuzzy Drinking Water Quality Index (FDWQI)
## An Implementation of "Fuzzy Expert System for Drinking Water Quality Index"
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the research article "Fuzzy Expert System for Drinking Water Quality Index"

The project utilizes fuzzy logic to assess drinking water quality based on multiple parameters, including:Turbidity (T), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen, Demand (BOD), pH value, Fecal Coliform (FC), *Mamdani-type Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)* is employed to classify water quality into three categories.
